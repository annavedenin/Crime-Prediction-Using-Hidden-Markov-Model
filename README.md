# Crime-Prediction-Using-Hidden-Markov-Model
The program improves statistical calculation method of time series family algorythems for predicting crimes by utilizing Hidden Markov Model.
- Analyzing a database containing crime reports filled by the Chicago police department. 
- Applying Statistical calculation on the data, based on the ROC method to predict crime probability.
- Applying the results on a probability matrix, based on the Hidden Markov Model.
- The application saves the results of previous predictions and trains itself to make future predictions more accurate.
- Developing a GUI for the police department which allows next-day prediction based on variables such as area and crime type.
