# Crime-Prediction-Using-Hidden-Markov-Model
The program improves statistical calculation method of time series family algorythems for predicting crimes by utilizing Hidden Markov Model.
- Analyzing a database containing crime reports filled by the Chicago police department. 
- Applying Statistical calculation on the data, based on the ROC method to predict crime probability.
- Applying the results on a probability matrix, based on the Hidden Markov Model.
- The application saves the results of previous predictions and trains itself to make future predictions more accurate.
- Developing a GUI for the police department which allows next-day prediction based on variables such as area and crime type.

  This program was writen as final project of Software Engineering Department at ORT Braude College of Engineering ( july 2018 ) 
   
* The program expect to recive .csv of the format:  [date,IUCR,Community Area,Year]

* The data may be found on Chicago Data Portal or be downloaded from :
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/2003-to-Present/vb24-695p/data

[After you enter the link press "Export" and selet "CSV" option]

* First upload must be from 2003, in future upload you may upload file from last date up to present.
we provided a file for first upload that is updated up to 06/23/2018 for convenience.

* If for some Community Area and IUSR the result is NAN this shown that there where no crimes of that type in the area
